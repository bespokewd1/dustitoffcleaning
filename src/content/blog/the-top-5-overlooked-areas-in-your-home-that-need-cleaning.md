Even the most thorough cleaners can miss certain spots around the house. These overlooked areas collect dust, dirt, and bacteria, affecting your home's cleanliness and your health. At Dust It Off Cleaning Services, we ensure every corner gets the attention it deserves! Here are the top five areas you’re probably forgetting to clean—and how to tackle them.



### 1. Ceiling Fans and Light Fixtures

Dust builds up quickly on ceiling fans and light fixtures. When the fan is on, it spreads dust around, worsening allergies and making your room dustier faster.


**Tip:**

1. Use a microfiber cloth or fan duster to trap dust.
2. Carefully remove light covers and wash them with warm soapy water.
3. Turn off the power before cleaning.

**Hack:**

1. Use an old pillowcase over fan blades to catch dust!

### 2. Baseboards and Trim

Baseboards collect dust, pet hair, and scuff marks, especially in high-traffic areas. Dirty baseboards can make a clean room look messy.

**Tip:**

1. Vacuum baseboards with a brush attachment.
2. Wipe with a damp cloth and all-purpose cleaner.
3. Use a cotton swab for corners and grooves.

### 3. Behind and Under Appliances

Out of sight, out of mind—until you move the fridge and find dust and crumbs. Neglecting these areas can attract pests and reduce appliance efficiency.

**Tip:**
1. Move appliances like fridges and ovens to clean behind them.
2. Clean fridge coils to improve efficiency.

### 4. Air Vents and Filters

Dust, allergens, and pollutants can circulate through your home if vents and filters aren’t cleaned regularly.

**Tip:**

1. Remove vent covers and wash with warm soapy water.
2. Vacuum inside the ducts to catch dust.
3. Replace filters every 1-3 months.

### 5. Remote Controls, Light Switches, and Door Handles

Dust, allergens, and pollutants can circulate through your home if vents and filters aren’t cleaned regularly.

**Tip:**

1. Wipe with disinfectant wipes or a cloth dampened with 70% isopropyl alcohol.
2. Clean these surfaces at least once a week.

Regularly cleaning these forgotten spots can make a big difference in your home’s cleanliness and air quality. If it feels overwhelming, let Dust It Off Cleaning Services handle it!
